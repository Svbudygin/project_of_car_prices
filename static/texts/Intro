Prices of cars in Russia: DataSet analysis

Introduction:

Lots of people have their own cars, and some of them are know a lot about the pricing of different types of cars. But the fact is that no one knows exactly what prices depend on. So, someppeople suppose that sports cars from very expensive brands such as Ferrari or Lamborghini cost the most, but alas we have models of not so luxurious cars such as Mercedes that cost more. BMW fans may argue that prices depends only on horsepower and engine type. However, this logic falters when we take into account ancient cars, with only 20 hp, costing millions of dollars. Finally, prices are not hang on a singular factor. To move deeply into this complexity of connections between horsepower, mileage, and year, I intend to show correlations, graphs, and other patterns using tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Before we get started, take a quick look at a transcript of each of the items of my dataset, which I have collected especially for you.
