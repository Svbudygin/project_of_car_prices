A 3D graph illustrates the relationship between the year of manufacture, mileage and price of Mercedes, ГАЗ, BMW and others. Key observations include:

Year compared to price:
New cars tend to have higher prices, with different trends for each brand.
Looking at our data, we can notice some interesting things:
Mercedes-Benz has a lot of new cars, and they should be more expensive than ГАЗ.
There are also quite a few ГАЗ with high mileage.
In the BMW category, most cars are priced lower than Mercedes, with the exception of those that are more expensive than most ГАЗ cars.

Mileage vs price:
There are significant differences in mileage for each brand.

Brand differentiation:
Colored dots differentiate brands by highlighting unique pricing and mileage trends.

Information for further analysis:
Questions arise about factors influencing pricing, but to understand this we need more in-depth research.

My next chart shows mileage by year considering the price (circle size) of the issue for different brands (so it depends on three or more parameters).
You might think that if a car is newer, then its mileage is lower, and in fact this is true for most brands (eg Mercedes-Benz),
but I found a brand (GAZ) that makes my previous statement not entirely reliable.
