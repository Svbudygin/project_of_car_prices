Data cleanup and Transformation

In this table, there are numerous missing values. Let me work with them

Initially, if the year information is absent, it would be great to compute the mean year for cars with the same name (model). However, if a vehicle's name uniquely identified, then finding its year becomes impossible, so I decided to drop this rows from my dataset.
Similarly, I will apply the same strategy to the power column. To execute this, I will construct a pivot table and introduce two new columns, that will display the average horsepower and year for each car name (model).
As for mileage, a NaN value implies a new vehicle with the mileage value of 0.
Non-numeric columns will have NaN entries replaced with 'information not given,' as these columns serve just additional details.
In the interest of making analysis more simple, I have dropped columns such as 'description,' 'link,' 'location,' and 'parse_date'.
Furthermore, I have standardized the column names to lowercase.
For "fuel type", "transmission", "name", "brand" and "price", I removed rows containing deleted NaN entries. This step is very important because attempting to replace NaN values in these columns is not possible due to lack of information.
I have also change NaN values in the 'color' column by "Белый," following the common practice on Auto.ru, where an absence of color denotes as a white vehicle.
Additionally, I have reset the indices and reform certain columns, including 'power,' 'year,' and 'mileage,' to integer format.
