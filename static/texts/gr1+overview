Overview
After cleaning up our file, adding a few columns, and rearranging the rows, we have observed the key statistics of our dataset.
We now a lot about the values and items we will be working with.
It's time to visualize straightforward aspects.

I have chosen to create several line graphs that compare price and year,
mileage and price, and mileage and power.
As for the last comparison, it may initially seem unreasonable, but, as depicted below, there are some consistencies.
Additionally, I have opted to generate statistics specifically for Mercedes-Benz, rather than for every car, to make my comparisons are more beautiful and to avoid cluttering the statistics.
