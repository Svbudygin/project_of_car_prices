More Detailed overview

As we explore our data set further,
it becomes necessary to print out a correlation analysis that shows linear relationships between two variables.
By focusing on our number columns (price, year, horsepower, mileage),
I intend to find out the relationships between these values and identify hidden trends,
indirect associations and dependencies.
