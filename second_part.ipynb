    "# Overview\n",
    "After cleaning up our file, adding a few columns, and efficiently rearranging the rows, we've observed the key statistics of our dataset. We now comprehend the primary values and items we'll be working with. It's time to visualize straightforward aspects that are easy to comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I have chosen to create several line graphs that compare price and year, mileage and price, and mileage and power. Regarding the latter comparison, it may initially seem unconventional, but, as depicted below, it bears a closer resemblance to a genuine line graph with discernible dependencies, especially when juxtaposed with the other graphs. Additionally, I have opted to generate statistics specifically for Mercedes-Benz, rather than for every car, to ensure my comparisons are more pertinent and to avoid cluttering the statistics.\n",
    "2) My second plot, presented in the form of a histogram, serves the purpose of visually depicting the distribution of cars across specific brands by quantifying the frequency of each brand. This graphical representation is valuable in providing a quick and intuitive understanding of the dataset's brand distribution, facilitating insights into the relative abundance or scarcity of different brands within the overall dataset.\n",
    "3) The third and fourth graphs take the form of scatter plots, delineating the correlation between price and year for all cars in the dataset, with a special focus on Mercedes-Benz. These visualizations aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the pricing dynamics evolve over the years for both the entire dataset and the specific brand. By employing scatter plots, we gain insights into the dispersed distribution of prices relative to the manufacturing years, offering a nuanced perspective on the pricing trends within the dataset and the specific Mercedes-Benz subset.\n",
    "4) Last but certainly not least, I've presented two graphs depicting the count of Mercedes-Benz vehicles on the market across various years and the distribution of vehicles based on their horsepower. These visualizations serve to elucidate the fluctuation in the availability of Mercedes-Benz cars over different years and offer insights into the prevalence of various horsepower categories within the dataset."

    "As we delve further into our dataset, it becomes imperative to conduct a correlation analysisâ€”a statistical gauge delineating the magnitude and direction of linear associations between two variables. Focusing on our numeric columns (price, year, power, mileage), I intend to elucidate the interrelationships among these values and reveal latent patterns or trends. The meticulous scrutiny of correlations involving horsepower, price, mileage, and year seeks to unravel consequential associations and dependencies. This analytical endeavor promises to furnish valuable insights, illuminating how alterations in one variable may wield influence over another, thereby refining our comprehension of the nuanced dynamics inherent in our dataset."
